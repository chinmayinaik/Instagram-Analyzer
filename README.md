Instagram-Analyzer
This project focuses on analyzing Instagram trends (popular hashtags, trending songs) using a comprehensive dataset from GitHub. Tools: Utilize Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization. Focus: Identify patterns in hashtag usage, song popularity, comments, and likes to understand content spread and popularity. 
This project is limited to analyzing Instagram trends using a static dataset of publicly available data, focusing exclusively on Instagram and not incorporating real-time data collection or other social media platforms. 
There were four phases in this research, i.e., data collection, data filtration, analysis,  popularity prediction and interactive visualization.

1. Data Preprocessing:
a. Data Cleaning: This step involves removing duplicate entries, handling missing values by imputation or deletion, and correcting inconsistencies in the dataset. Ensuring the data is clean and accurate is crucial for reliable analysis.
b. Data Transformation: Standardizing data formats, converting data types, parsing dates, and extracting relevant features such as the frequency of hashtag usage and metrics related to song popularity.

2. Data Filtering:
a. Relevance Filtering: Filtering the dataset to retain only relevant data points that pertain to popular hashtags and trending songs. This step includes selecting data within specific date ranges or focusing on particular categories.
b. Noise Reduction:
Removing outliers and irrelevant data to ensure the analysis is not skewed by anomalies.

3. Trend Analysis:
a. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting descriptive statistics to understand the distribution, central tendencies, and spread of key variables. Creating visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate patterns and trends.
b. Correlation Analysis: Examining relationships between variables, such as the correlation between hashtag usage and post engagement levels, to uncover underlying patterns.

4. Popularity Prediction:
a. Predictive Modeling: Developing models to predict the future popularity of hashtags and songs based on historical data. This involves using machine learning algorithms such as random forest  regression, b.Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of predictive models using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to ensure accuracy and reliability

Predictive models developed will be based on historical data and may not account for sudden changes in user behavior or external factors. 

Deliverables include a comprehensive data analysis report detailing preprocessing steps and key findings, trained predictive models for forecasting engagement metrics, an interactive Streamlit dashboard for dynamic exploration of trends, and actionable insights with recommendations for optimizing Instagram strategies.
