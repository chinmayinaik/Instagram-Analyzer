This project focuses on analyzing Instagram trends (popular hashtags, trending songs) using a comprehensive dataset from GitHub. Tools: Utilize Python, Streamlit, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data visualization. Focus: Identify patterns in hashtag usage, song popularity, comments, and likes to understand content spread and popularity. 
This project is limited to analyzing Instagram trends using a static dataset of publicly available data, focusing exclusively on Instagram and not incorporating real-time data collection or other social media platforms. 

Predictive models developed will be based on historical data and may not account for sudden changes in user behavior or external factors. 

Deliverables include a comprehensive data analysis report detailing preprocessing steps and key findings, trained predictive models for forecasting engagement metrics, an interactive Streamlit dashboard for dynamic exploration of trends, and actionable insights with recommendations for optimizing Instagram strategies.
